h1. Introduction

GeoTools is a set of tools for manipulating geo hashes and geometric shapes in the wgs 84 coordinate system. A geo hash is a representation of a coordinate that interleaves the bit representations of the latitude and longitude and base32 encodes the result. This string representation has a very useful property: geo hashes of nearby coordinates will have the same prefix. As is observed in this blog post: http://blog.notdot.net/2009/11/Damn-Cool-Algorithms-Spatial-indexing-with-Quadtrees-and-Hilbert-Curves, geo hashes effectively encode the path to a leaf in a quad tree.

The algorithms used for implementing the functionality in GeoTools are mostly well known and commonly used in 2D graphics. However, I have not found any comprehensive open sourced implementation for the wgs 84 coordinate system. 

The key functionality that motivated the creation of this library was the ability to cover shapes on a map with geo hashes for indexing purposes. To support that, I needed some elementary geometric operations implemented.

h1. Features

* GeoGeometry class with methods that allow you to:
** Calculate distance between two coordinates using the haversine algorithm.
** check bounding box containment for a point
** check polygon containment for a point
** get the center for a polygon
** get bounding box for a polygon
** convert circle to a polygon
** create a polygon from a point cloud
** translate a wgs84 coordinate by x & y meters along the latitude and longitude
* GeoHashUtils class with methods that allow you to: 
** encode and decode geo hashes; this functionality has been adapted from the original Apache Lucene implementation of this class.
** check containment of a point in a geohash
** find out the boundingbox of a geohash
** find out neighboring geohashes east, west, south, or north of a geohash
** get the 32 sub geo hashes for a geohash, or the north/south halves, or the NE, NW, SE, SW quarters.
** convert geo hash to a BitSet and a BitSet to a geo hash
** cover lines, paths, polygons, or circles with geo hashes

I've deliberately kept the design simple and non object oriented. These classes have no external dependencies and only use the java.util package and the java.lang.Math class. Consequently it should be easy to port this functionality to whatever other language. Also, I've not attempted to implement Point, Polygon, Path, Circle, or other classes to support this library. The reason for this is very simple: these things are commonly implemented in other frameworks and any attempt from my side to impose my own implementation would conflict with the need of others to reuse their own classes. I think it is somewhat of a design smell that world + dog feels compelled to implement their own Point class. 

So instead, a point is represented as a latitude, longitude pair of doubles or as an array of two doubles (like in geo json). Likewise, paths and polygons are represented as arrays of points. A circle is a point and a radius. This should enable anyone to integrate this functionality easily.

h1. Caveats

* Some of the algorithms used have limitations with respect to where you can use them. Generally things should be fine around the date line (if not report bugs). However, the poles are tricky and some of the algorithms get inaccurate or simply fail to exit. Because most data sets lack data for the poles, this should not be a big issue for most. Some of the algorithms now throw an exception if you try this. I'm not currently planning a fix but would appreciate pull requests for this.
* There is currently not a whole lot of input validation in this library. That means some of the algorithms might do unexpected things if you call them in the wrong way. Input validation would make using this library more expensive and that is something I'm trying to avoid.
* Some of the algorithms have quadratic or exponential complexity and you can easily trigger situations where execution time is going to be substantial and/or you run out of memory. For example covering a circle with a radius of a few hundred kilometers with geohashes of length 10 is probably not a great idea. If you are unsure, use getSuitableHashLength() and add 1 or 2 to get good enough granularity.

h1. Installation

It's a maven project. So, checking it out and doing a mvn clean install should do the trick.

Alternatively, you can exercise your rights under the license and simply copy and adapt as needed. The "license":https://github.com/jillesvangurp/xmltools/blob/master/LICENSE allows you to do this and I have no problems with this although I do appreciate attribution.

Should anyone like this licensed differently, please contact me.

If anyone wants to fix stuff just send me a pull request.

h1. License

Like all my other projects, this project is licensed under the so-called MIT license. However, GeoHashUtils.java was copied and 
adapted from Apache Lucene and I have retained the Apache License for that file, as required in that license. Both licenses are compatible and should also pose no issues when used with software under most other OSS licenses.
