h1. Introduction

GeoTools is a small project where I've gathered some code that I've used in the past for working with coordinates and geohashes.

h1. Features

* GeoGeometry
** Calculate distance between two coordinates using the haversine algorithm.
** check bounding box containment for a point
** check polygon containment for a point
** get bounding box for a polygon
* Expanded version of Apache's GeoHashUtils with 
** a contains method for checking if a coordinate is contained in a geohash
** get the east, west, north, and south geohashes for any geo hash
** get the 32 sub geo hashes for a geohash
** convert geo hash to a BitSet and a BitSet to a geo hash

h1. Installation

It's a maven project. So, checking it out and doing a mvn clean install should do the trick.

Alternatively, you may use my github maven repository, which is where I deploy releases for some of my projects. In order to use this, you have to configure your settings.xml as explained here: https://github.com/jillesvangurp/mvnrepo

Then you can add the following dependency:

<pre>
<code>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.jillesvangurp</groupId>
    <artifactId>geohash</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
</code>
</pre>

Alternatively, you can exercise your rights under the license and simply copy and adapt. The "license":https://github.com/jillesvangurp/xmltools/blob/master/LICENSE allows you to do this and I have no problems with this.

Should anyone like this licensed differently, please contact me.

If anyone wants to fix stuff just send me a pull request.

h1. License

Like all my other projects, this project is licensed under the so-called MIT license. However, GeoHashUtils.java was copied and 
adapted from Apache Lucene and I have retained the Apache License for that file. Both licenses are compatible and should also pose
no issues when used with software under most other OSS licenses.
